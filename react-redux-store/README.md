## React Solo Project

The whole idea started for this website through my girlfriend. My lovely girlfriend Jessica paints incredible pictures. She has never really had an outlet to put her paintings out there for the world to see, so I decided to create her a website. I wanted the design to be super simplistic, but still show some website design capability. The end-result came out looking much better than I had initially anticipated.
