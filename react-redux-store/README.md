# React Solo Project

---

The whole idea started for this website through my girlfriend. My lovely girlfriend Jessica paints incredible pictures. She has never really had an outlet to put her paintings out there for the world to see, so I decided to create her a website. I wanted the design to be super simplistic, but still show some website design capability. The end-result came out looking much better than I had initially anticipated.

## Key Features and Components

- Utilizes multiple different aspects of React-Bootstrap.
- Has a shopping page with beautifully laid out products, the ability to view individual products, and the ability to add products to your cart.
- The cart page has all the items that have been added to your cart, and I also added some functionality so that you see a total at the bottom of your cart.
- Has some error-handling, which will direct you to a custom-made 404 page when you direct to a route that is not specified.

## What Was Learned?

Some of the biggest takeaways that I had from this website were as follows: Websites take a LOT of design. Sitting on my own, and completing just the front-end design of a somewhat functional website, really truly makes me understand how much work goes into a website behind the scenes. Having such short time-frames on our somewhat in-depth projects, leaves little room for error, and a lot of room for self-disappointment. I always set a certain standard whenever I feel like I should be performing a certain way, but then I remember how much work ACTUALLY goes into deploying real websites. Once that reality hits me, I feel a little bit better about the work that I’ve created in a little less than a week’s time. I also learned a lot about design, got a bit more comfortable with React and Redux, utilized Toastify (which was surprisingly easy), and became especially familiar with media queries.

## Future Additions

1. I’d like to add a little bit more styling to the front page, and add a little bit more information to really make it pop.
2. Ideally, I’d like to clean up the shop page just a little bit, and maybe add a flip effect to each card, which then shows the details about the cards.
3. I’d also like for the cart to be a modal (which is when another little screen pops up with the screen before in the background), which pops up over the current screen and displays your cart.
4. I plan on adding a back-end to this project, user authentication, and adding Swipe in the future so people can actually purchase paintings when the time comes.
